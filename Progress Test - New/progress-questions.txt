On each of the following questions, please note any questions you would have to your manager
(if the question is vague, etc..) as to clarify the requirement.
Please answer each question and send back the resulting .p or answers.

We do not require/expect that you will have Progress installed on your computer when answering
these questions.  Write the code the best you can in any editor you wish (notepad is fine). We
will not be doing syntax checks of the code, the goal is to check logic and basic Progress
code knowledge.

Using the above table definition, write a .p that does the following:

Accepts two inputs:
  1) Character value containing an entity-code
  2) Integer value containg an order-no


Outputs a temp-table with a copy of all records matching the input criteria.

Before creating the temp-table update each filtered edi-outbound record but only if the
xdock-entity field is not blank.  Assign the  send-date field value to today's
date if the record is not currently locked by another user.
Write how you might handle the lock.
*/


2) Given the following string

DEFINE VARIABLE vcMonths AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.
vcMonths = "Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec".

Write a snippet of code that will assign the string in reverse order (i.e. "Dec,Nov,Oct...") in
to a new variable.

3) Look at the attached program progtest.p
-What can you tell me about the transaction scoping in this program
-What improvements to the code can you make (attach improved code)

4) Looking at the attached .csv file (cust-sales.csv)
-Create a temp-table to store the data
-Import the data from disk into the temp table
-Sum the sales data by customer into a new temp-table
-Export the resulting data to a new .csv file

5) Given the attached .w file (prog-win.w)
  This program contains a simple temp-table and free form browse to display the records.
  There is one button 'delete' that needs the code written for it.
  Write the code for the delete button, it needs to delete the selected row, first asking
  the user if they are sure they want to delete the record.
